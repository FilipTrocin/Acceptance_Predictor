-------------------------
Project based on **Linear Regression** predicting 'Chance of Admit' to one of the US universities on 
an engineering course. The predictor takes various features into considerations such as:
 - GRE Score
 - TOEFL Score
 - University Rating Attended (higher better)
 - SOP
 - LOR
 - CGPA
 - Internship taken (1-yes, 0-no)
 
Additionally, it produces 2D graphical visualisation displaying 'Chance of Admit' (Y-axis) and one of the contributing factors (X-axis), which can be modified for any of the mentioned above


### INFO

- Code tested with Python ver. 3.6
- Saved **admission_model.pickle** is for Python ver. 3.6
- All of the necessary packages needed to run the code are on Anaconda virtual environment, which is recommended to work on
