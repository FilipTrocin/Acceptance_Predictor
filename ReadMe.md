## Acceptance Predictor
is a project based on **Linear Regression** predicting 'Chance of Admit' to one of the US universities on 
an engineering course. The predictor takes various features into considerations such as:
 - GRE Score
 - TOEFL Score
 - University Rating Attended (higher better)
 - SOP
 - LOR
 - CGPA
 - Internship taken (1-yes, 0-no)
Moreover, Acceptance Predictor produces 2D graphical visualisation displaying 'Chance of Admit' at Y-axis and one of the
contributing factors which can be modified by any of the mentioned above (line 58)


### INFO
- **admission_model.pickle** was saved working with Python 3.6
- All of the packages are already installed on an Anaconda environment, at which that project is based.
